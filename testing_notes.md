Tested program by redesigning ParA with the following results:
1. 53.94% identity, ATP binding in ATP-bound ParA structure
2. 54.18% identity, binds ATP in ADP-bound ParA structure
3. 53.70% id, binds ATP in ADP-bound ParA structure
4. 52.27% id, binds ATP in ATP-bound ParA structure
5. 51.55% id, binds ATP in ATP-bound ParA structure
6. 51.31% id, binds ATP in ATP-bound ParA structure
7. 47.97% id, binds ATP in ATP-bound ParA structure
8. 50.12% id, low confidence, binds ATP in ADP-bound ParA structure
9. 50.12% id, binds ATP in ADP-bound ParA structure
10. 49.16% id, binds ATP in ATP-bound ParA structure

Based on this, structures 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 should be tested for ADP binding. Goal: find one that binds ADP in ADP-bound structure. Results:
1. binds ADP in ADP-bound ParA structure
4. low-confidence hybrid structure
5. binds ADP in ADP-bound ParA structure
6. binds ADP in ADP-bound ParA structure
7. low-confidence but binds ADP in ADP-bound ParA structure
10. hybrid structure

sequence #1 seems to be really good as it had ipTM of 0.86 (ADP) and 0.92 (ATP) for both forms. I'm calling this one (or whichever one ends up working) the boneturner hydrolase
