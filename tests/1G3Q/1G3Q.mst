# Test program #1
start all
# Define the output to be a single chain of length 237
output A:237
# Load ADP/ATP versions
structure MinD_ADP > A
structure MinD_ATP > A
# Everything after ">" determines how chains in the structure are mapped to chains in the output

# Define fixed residues
NEVER MIND, no conformational change so I'm ending this test right here
